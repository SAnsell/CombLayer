\section{Example 1}

\subsection{Purpose: Creating the initial world}

This example is the first stage on the process of building a full model.
The only purpose of this example is to create an unpopulated world (a large
void sphere) and generate an executable that can output a valid MCNP(X),
FLUKA or PHITS output.

\subsection{Creating required files}

Assuming that we are going to build a new project that does not
currently exist and for this case, we will call it {\it example}
\footnote{The completed version of this test can be obtained by
checking out the example1 branch of CombLayer}.

\subsubsection{Create a new main() function}

Move into the Main directory:

Choose an existing project and copy it  --  in this case
copy the {\it xrayHut.cxx} file into {\it example.cxx}

\subsection{Description of the main file}

The next step is to edit the main file and chenage it from working
with the xrayHut model and using your new example model. First let use
overview the different parts of the file Main/example.cxx. 

Consider main file {\it Main/example.cxx}:
\begin{itemize}
\item{{\bf includes [lines 22-58]} : This are all the standard
  include. They allows the construction of the makeExample
  class. CombLayer uses an independent include file system in that no
  .h file containes any other include statement.}
  
\item{{\bf ELog construction [lines 60-67]} : This is standard static
  constructors for the controlled streams (they are like std::cout but
  have more control and colour output). Don't touch! }

\item{{\bf activateLogging [lines 75]} : This activates the logging
  system, that will give output with the class and method that output
  came from. It also gives a full calling structure of exceptions.
  You update this area if you want more (less) output.}

\item{{\bf setMaterialDataBase [lines 77]} : CombLayer provides a list
  of named (not only numbers) materials that the user can use. This
  is where they are populated. Addional materials can be added in this
  function or separate functions if needed.}

\item{{\bf createSimulation [lines 78]} : This does NOT create the model
  but it produces the empty simulation of the correct type e.g. MCNP or FLUKA.
  This is controlled by the inputs on the command line (e.g --FLUKA).}
  
\item{{\bf createInputs [lines 86]} : This function tells the CombLayer
  executable what input flags (e.g. --tally) will be
  recognised by the code.  The call to createInputs creates the general
  input flag (e.g. --FLUKA) that are common to all CombLayer executables,
  but if you need/want any special calls for your code,
  then create a new funtion here (e.g. createExampleInputs)
  and typically that function will call createInputs adding
  the special extra parts you need. This code only registers that these
  flags will be accepted on the command line. Parsing and acting on this input
  will be handled later.}
  
\item{{\bf exampleVariables [lines 93]} : This is a user written function.
  It populates all the variables for the model that you are building. Every variables should be defined by this function.}

\item{{\bf makeExample BOj [lines 95-96]} :
  This creates the class which is going to construct the whole geometric
  model. Doesn't matter if this is simple (as this case) or super complex,
  just one call. }

\item{{\bf buildFullSimulation [lines 100-104]} :
  This does the construction of the output file (based normally on inputs
  etc). It constructs tallies/estimators and applies variance reduction etc }

\item{{\bf Catch [lines 108-124]} : This is the catch block if errors
  of various types are generated. In principle, you sould never see a
  General Exception except from your code but... while {\it ExitAbort} is
  for conditions that the code has not yet been written to deal with
  (e.g. Torus intersections) and {\it Exception failure} (the commonest error)
  is for things that the code can't process in respect to inputs
  (e.g. setting the radius of a cylinder to a negative number).
  }

\item{{\bf delete and return [lines 126-128] :
    These are the clean up lines to free memory and exit with appropiate
    error number (0 for success).}
}
  
\end{itemize}
  


\subsection{Changes for the main file}

Edit example.cxx and make standard changes because we don't want name overlap.
In the {\it \#include}'s change

\begin{itemize}
\item{
  {\it \#include ``xrayHutVariables.h''}
  $\rightarrow$
  {\it \#include ``exampleVariables.h''}
}

\item{
  {\it \#include ``makeHutch.h''}
  $\rightarrow$
  {\it \#include ``makeExample.h''}
}

\item{
  {\it setVariable::xrayHutVariables(SimPtr->getDataBase());}
  $\rightarrow$
  {\it setVariable::exampleVariables(SimPtr->getDataBase());}
}

\item{
  {\it  exampleSystem::makeXrayHut BObj; }
  $\rightarrow$
  {\it  exampleSystem::makeExample BObj; }
}

\end{itemize}
