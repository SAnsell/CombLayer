\subsection{New file in directory}

If you are just adding a new class to an existing directory, then it
is necessary to tell {\it cmake} that it has a new file. Edit the
CMakeLists.txt file to add your file to the source list at the top of the file.

\subsection{New directory with multiple classes}

Start with the toplevel CMakeLists.txt file:

Add any include directories to the corresponding \_INCLUDE variable (e.g.
MAXIV\_INCLIUDE

If the directory is a top level directory (e.g. global), then add a
add_subdirectory(your_file), however, if it is in a subdirectory (e.g. Model)
find the corresponding CMakeList.txt file which is the parent of your new directory and place the new add_subdirectory(your_file) in that CMakeLists.txt file.

Add the library name to the appropiate set(XXX\_LIB list) e.g.
set(MAXIV\_LIB ...)

Finally you need to add a CMakeLists.txt file to the directory with
your new source code.
