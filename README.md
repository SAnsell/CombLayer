MCNP(X) project builder using C++ 

The object of this program is to produce highly parametric space-filling geometry models described by quadratic surfaces. 
The models are primarily for used to build MCNPX models for nuclear simulation but it can be quickly addapted for any 
other such geometry-type problem.  

The program has its own internal tracking system, which allows simple validation, variance reduction to be done, and 
property checking. 

The current build has models that cover the ISIS neutron facility, the ESS, and others. 

Contributions, comments and bug issues welcome. Please see the documents section for an introduction to the program philosophy and useage.
