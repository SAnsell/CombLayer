  \class RuleBinary
  \brief Represents a rule in a binary list
  \author S. Ansell
  \version 1.0
  \date May 2006

  Holds a binary tree of the geometry object
  rule. Has simple information about the surface
  map so that extra knowledge can be obtained.
  (Decisions like px 5 > px 6 etc. )
  
  The tree can be expressed as a Essentual Prime Implicate form
